# simple-aquarium
## At the beginning
It was a simple aquarium with some fish and shark disappearing when you hover them.
## Now
It is a game with randomly spawning fish, which you should catch. You can start the game by clicking "Play" button or pressing "Space" or "Enter". 
When you click a fish, it disappears and you earn 1 point. You have 15 seconds to earn as many points as you can!
